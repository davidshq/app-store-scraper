# App Store Scraper: TODO

## Status Key

- 游릭 In progress, nearly complete
- 游리 Started but needs more work
- 游댃 Planned for future

## Performance Optimization

- 游리 Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Implement request deduplication
  - Add request caching strategies
- 游리 Improve rate limiting strategies for better API compliance
  - Current implementation uses `limiter` library but can be enhanced
  - Add adaptive rate limiting based on API responses

### Testing Improvements

#### Priority Areas

- 游리 Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Tests for error-types.ts implemented but more comprehensive tests needed
  - Add tests for network error scenarios
- 游리 Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules
  - Add end-to-end test scenarios
- 游리 Increase overall test coverage
  - Current coverage is good but not complete
  - Focus on edge cases and error scenarios

### Documentation

- 游리 Add more TypeScript examples and improve type documentation
  - Add usage examples for each module
  - Improve JSDoc comments
- 游리 Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
  - Add detailed API reference
  - Include common use cases and best practices

### CI/CD

- 游리 Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Add test reports
  - Add dependency updates
  - Add automated PR reviews
- 游리 Add code coverage reporting to CI pipeline
  - Coverage configuration exists in vitest.config.ts but not integrated with CI
  - Add coverage thresholds
- 游댃 Add automated release workflow
  - Currently manual publishing process
  - Add semantic versioning automation

### Code Quality

- 游리 Improve type safety
  - Add stricter TypeScript checks
  - Remove any types where possible
- 游리 Code organization
  - Review and optimize module structure
  - Consider splitting large files
