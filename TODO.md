# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

## Status Legend

- 游리 In Progress
- 游댃 Planned/Not Started

## Core Improvements

### Error Handling

- 游댃 Add better retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Basic retry implemented in http-client.ts, but needs exponential backoff

### Performance Optimization

- 游리 Enhance the caching mechanism with more configurable options
  - Basic memoization implemented, needs method-specific configurations
- 游댃 Implement adaptive rate limiting based on response headers
  - Basic rate limiting implemented via Bottleneck, needs response header adaptation
- 游댃 Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Need to implement request batching and deduplication

## Testing Improvements

### Current Status

- 游리 Converting test files to TypeScript
  - Several test files still in JavaScript with @ts-nocheck
- 游리 Improving coverage for critical components
  - Good coverage for core functionality, gaps in utility modules

### Priority Areas

- 游리 Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Basic error tests in place, needs expansion
- 游댃 Test rate limiting and retry logic in HTTP client
  - Missing tests for rate limiting behavior
- 游리 Add tests for memoization and caching behavior
  - Basic tests in app.test.js, needs more comprehensive testing
- 游댃 Validate integrity of mapping data in constants.ts
  - No validation tests for constants data
- 游댃 Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules
- 游댃 Add specific tests for Bottleneck rate limiting implementation
  - Needs implementation and testing

### Testing Roadmap

- 游댃 Consider migration to Jest or Vitest for better ESM support
  - Currently using Mocha with workarounds for ESM
- 游댃 Implement standardized mock responses for all API tests
  - Inconsistent mocking approaches across test files

## New Improvements

### Type System

- 游리 Improve type definitions for external consumers
  - index.d.ts provides types but needs better interfaces

### CI/CD

- 游리 Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic workflow in place, needs test reports
- 游댃 Add code coverage reporting
  - No coverage reporting implemented
