# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

## Ongoing Improvements

### Performance Optimization

- ğŸŸ¡ Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Basic request batching implemented, could use request deduplication
- ğŸŸ¡ Improve rate limiting strategies for better API compliance
  - Current implementation uses `limiter` library but can be enhanced

### Testing Improvements

#### Priority Areas

- ğŸŸ¡ Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Tests for error-types.ts implemented but more comprehensive tests needed
- ğŸŸ¡ Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules
- ğŸŸ¡ Increase overall test coverage
  - Current coverage is good but not complete

### Documentation

- ğŸŸ¡ Add more TypeScript examples and improve type documentation
- ğŸŸ¡ Create comprehensive API documentation with examples

### CI/CD

- ğŸŸ¡ Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic workflow in place (.github/workflows/test.yml), needs test reports
- ğŸŸ¡ Add code coverage reporting to CI pipeline
  - Coverage configuration exists in vitest.config.ts but not integrated with CI
- ğŸ”„ Add automated release workflow
  - Currently manual publishing process

### Future Considerations

- ğŸ”„ Update API endpoints to handle App Store changes
- ğŸ”„ Support additional App Store features as they become available
- ğŸ”„ Consider browser compatibility (with appropriate bundling)

## Status Key

- âœ… Completed
- ğŸŸ¢ In progress, nearly complete
- ğŸŸ¡ Started but needs more work
- ğŸ”„ Planned for future
