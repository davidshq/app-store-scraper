# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

## Core Improvements

### Error Handling

- ðŸŸ¡ Add better retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Basic retry implemented in http-client.ts, but needs exponential backoff
- ðŸŸ¡ Improve error type definitions in error-types.ts
  - File exists but could use more specific error types for different API failures

### Performance Optimization

- ðŸŸ¡ Enhance the caching mechanism with more configurable options
  - Basic memoization implemented, method-specific configurations available but needs refinement
- ðŸ”„ Implement adaptive rate limiting based on response headers
  - Basic rate limiting implemented via Bottleneck, needs response header adaptation
- ðŸ”„ Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Need to implement request batching and deduplication

## Testing Improvements

### Current Status

- ðŸŸ¡ Converting test files to TypeScript
  - 4 test files converted to TypeScript (store-utils, rate-limiter, http-client, app-transform)
  - 14 test files still in JavaScript with @ts-nocheck
- ðŸŸ¡ Improving coverage for critical components

### Priority Areas

- ðŸŸ¡ Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Basic error tests in place, needs expansion
- ðŸŸ¡ Add tests for memoization and caching behavior
  - Basic tests in app.test.js, needs more comprehensive testing
- ðŸŸ¡ Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules

### Testing Roadmap

- ðŸ”„ Implement standardized mock responses for all API tests
  - Inconsistent mocking approaches across test files
- ðŸŸ¡ Migrate from mixed Mocha/Vitest setup to Vitest only
  - Currently supports both Mocha and Vitest test runners

## TypeScript & Type System

- ðŸŸ¡ Improve type definitions for external consumers
  - index.d.ts provides types but needs better interfaces
- ðŸŸ¡ Complete conversion of codebase to TypeScript
  - Main lib files converted, some utility functions need refinement
- ðŸ”„ Add runtime type validation to complement static TypeScript checks
  - Basic validation exists in validators.ts but could be expanded

## CI/CD

- ðŸŸ¡ Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic workflow in place (.github/workflows/test.yml), needs test reports
- ðŸŸ¡ Add code coverage reporting
  - Coverage configuration exists in vitest.config.ts but not integrated with CI
- ðŸ”„ Add automated release workflow
  - Currently manual publishing process

## Documentation

- âœ… Create API reference documentation
  - âœ… Implemented automated API documentation generation with TypeDoc
  - âœ… Created documentation structure and linking
  - âœ… Added script for easy documentation regeneration
- ðŸ”„ Add more code examples and use cases
  - Could enhance with more practical examples
