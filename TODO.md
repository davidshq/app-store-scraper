# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

## Status Legend

- 游리 In Progress
- 游댃 Planned/Not Started

## Core Improvements

### Error Handling

- 游리 Add better retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Basic retry implemented in http-client.ts, but needs exponential backoff

### Performance Optimization

- 游리 Enhance the caching mechanism with more configurable options
  - Basic memoization implemented, method-specific configurations available but needs refinement
- 游댃 Implement adaptive rate limiting based on response headers
  - Basic rate limiting implemented via Bottleneck, needs response header adaptation
- 游댃 Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Need to implement request batching and deduplication

## Testing Improvements

### Current Status

- 游리 Converting test files to TypeScript
  - Several test files still in JavaScript with @ts-nocheck
- 游리 Improving coverage for critical components
  - Added tests for utility modules: store-utils.ts, app-transform.ts

### Priority Areas

- 游리 Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Basic error tests in place, needs expansion
- 游리 Add tests for memoization and caching behavior
  - Basic tests in app.test.js, needs more comprehensive testing
- 游리 Validate integrity of mapping data in constants.ts
  - Added store-utils.ts tests that validate country mapping
- 游리 Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules

### Testing Roadmap

- 游댃 Implement standardized mock responses for all API tests
  - Inconsistent mocking approaches across test files

## TypeScript & Type System

- 游리 Improve type definitions for external consumers
  - index.d.ts provides types but needs better interfaces
- 游댃 Add runtime type validation to complement static TypeScript checks
  - Basic validation exists in validators.ts but could be expanded

## CI/CD

- 游리 Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic workflow in place, needs test reports
- 游댃 Add code coverage reporting
  - Test coverage configuration exists in vitest.config.ts but not integrated with CI

## Documentation

- 游댃 Create API reference documentation
  - Need to implement automated API documentation generation
