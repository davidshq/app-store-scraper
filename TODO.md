# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

### Error Handling

- 游리 Improve error type definitions in error-types.ts
  - Basic types implemented with ErrorCode enum and AppStoreScraperError class
  - Could use more specialized error types for different API endpoints

### Performance Optimization

- 游리 Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency
  - Basic request batching implemented, could use request deduplication

## Testing Improvements

### Priority Areas

- 游리 Add tests for error handling across all modules
  - Tests for error-types.ts implemented but more comprehensive tests needed
- 游리 Add integration tests for component interactions
  - Missing integration tests between modules

## CI/CD

- 游리 Improve GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic workflow in place (.github/workflows/test.yml), needs test reports
- 游리 Add code coverage reporting
  - Coverage configuration exists in vitest.config.ts but not integrated with CI
- 游댃 Add automated release workflow
  - Currently manual publishing process
