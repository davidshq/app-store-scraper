# App Store Scraper: Progress and Improvements

## Status Legend

- 游리 In Progress
- 游댃 Planned/Not Started

## Core Improvements

### Error Handling

- 游리 Apply consistent error handling across all modules
- 游댃 Add better retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures

### API Design & Input Validation

- 游리 Standardize input validation using validators.ts module
- 游리 Make parameter naming and option structures consistent across endpoints

### Performance Optimization

- 游댃 Enhance the caching mechanism with more configurable options
- 游댃 Implement adaptive rate limiting based on response headers
- 游댃 Optimize request flows to reduce API call frequency

### Code Organization

- 游리 Implement consistent async/await pattern across all modules
- 游리 Improve dependency injection consistency for better testability

## Testing Improvements

### Current Status

- 游리 Converting test files to TypeScript
- 游리 Improving coverage for critical components

### Priority Areas

- 游리 Add tests for error handling across all modules
- 游댃 Test rate limiting and retry logic in HTTP client
- 游댃 Add tests for memoization and caching behavior
- 游댃 Validate integrity of mapping data in constants.ts
- 游댃 Add integration tests for component interactions
- 游댃 Add specific tests for Bottleneck rate limiting implementation

### Testing Roadmap

- 游댃 Consider migration to Jest or Vitest for better ESM support
- 游댃 Implement standardized mock responses for all API tests

## Additional Features

- 游댃 Support more App Store endpoints
- 游댃 Add ability to fetch more detailed app information (e.g., in-app purchases)

## Documentation & Compatibility

- 游리 Improve JSDoc documentation across all modules
- 游리 Improve compatibility with CommonJS projects

## Specific TODOs

1. Convert remaining test files to TypeScript
2. Address TODO comments in files:
   - lib/suggest.ts: Add language support via Accept-Language header
   - lib/search.ts: Find a way to filter by device and refactor to allow memoization of the first request
3. Enhance test coverage for critical components, especially error handling and rate limiting
4. Implement more robust retry mechanisms for network requests
